B) (height, width, channels)
C) (width, height, channels)
D) (channels, width, height)

### Question 2
What is the purpose of image normalization in computer vision?

A) To resize images to the same dimensions
B) To scale pixel values to a standard range
C) To remove noise from images
D) To convert images to grayscale

### Question 3
What is transfer learning in computer vision?

A) Transferring images between devices
B) Using pre-trained models and fine-tuning for new tasks
C) Converting between image formats
D) Moving data between training and test sets

### Question 4
What does IoU (Intersection over Union) measure in object detection?

A) The speed of detection
B) The overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes
C) The number of objects detected
D) The confidence of predictions

### Question 5
Which augmentation technique helps prevent overfitting?

A) Resizing all images to the same size
B) Converting to grayscale
C) Random flips, rotations, and color jitter
D) Reducing image resolution

### Question 6
What is the difference between semantic and instance segmentation?

A) Semantic assigns classes to pixels, instance separates individual objects
B) They are the same thing
C) Semantic is faster than instance
D) Instance only works on small images

### Question 7
What is the purpose of non-maximum suppression (NMS) in object detection?

A) To speed up detection
B) To remove duplicate detections of the same object
C) To improve image quality
D) To reduce model size

### Question 8
Which metric is commonly used for image classification?

A) IoU
B) BLEU score
