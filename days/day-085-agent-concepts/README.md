### What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems that perceive their environment, reason about goals, make decisions, and take actions. Unlike simple LLM calls, agents can:
- Break down complex tasks into steps
- Use tools and external resources
- Maintain memory across interactions
- Self-correct and adapt strategies
