   - C) IT department
   - D) External vendors

4. **What is federated computational governance?**
   - A) Centralized control by one team

   - C) No governance
   - D) Manual approval processes

5. **When should you use data mesh?**
   - A) Always, for any organization

8. **What are common data mesh challenges?**
   - A) Too simple to implement
   - B) Cultural shift, skills gap, platform complexity, governance balance
   - C) Too expensive
   - D) No challenges

9. **What is a data product in data mesh?**
   - A) A database table
   - B) Domain-owned data with clear interface, quality SLAs, and documentation
   - C) A report
   - D) A data pipeline

10. **What role does the platform team play?**
    - A) Own all data products
    - B) Provide infrastructure, tools, and governance framework for domain teams
    - C) Build all pipelines
    - D) Manage all databases

## Answers

1. **B** - The four principles are: Domain ownership, Data as a product, Self-serve data platform, and Federated computational governance.

2. **B** - Data as a product means applying product thinking: making data discoverable, addressable, trustworthy, self-describing, secure, and interoperable with clear SLAs.

3. **B** - Domain teams (Sales, Marketing, Product, Finance, etc.) own their data end-to-end, not a central data team.

4. **B** - Federated governance means distributed decision-making with global standards (privacy, security) and domain-specific policies, automated through policy as code.

5. **B** - Data mesh is best for large organizations (>100 people) with multiple domains, complex data landscape, and central team bottlenecks. Not suitable for small teams.

6. **B** - A self-serve platform provides infrastructure, tools, templates, and governance framework enabling domain teams to create and manage data products independently.

7. **B** - Data mesh is a decentralized architecture with domain ownership, while data lake is centralized storage. Mesh can use lakes as storage layer.

8. **B** - Common challenges include cultural shift from centralized to distributed, skills gap in domain teams, platform complexity, and balancing governance with autonomy.

9. **B** - A data product is domain-owned data treated as a product with clear API/interface, quality guarantees, SLAs, documentation, and access controls.

10. **B** - Platform team provides infrastructure, tools, standards, and governance framework. Domain teams build and own data products using the platform.
