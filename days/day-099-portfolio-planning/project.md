# Day 99: Portfolio Planning - Project Guide

## Overview

Day 99 is about planning your portfolio and capstone project. This is your opportunity to showcase everything you've learned over the past 98 days.

---

## Goals

1. **Assess Your Skills** - Identify strengths and areas for growth
2. **Choose Your Focus** - Decide on portfolio direction
3. **Plan Your Capstone** - Design your final project
4. **Structure Your Portfolio** - Organize your work
5. **Create a Roadmap** - Build a realistic timeline

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Skill Assessment

Complete the skill assessment in `portfolio_planner.py`:

```python
python portfolio_planner.py
```

Rate yourself (1-5) on:
- Data Engineering skills
- Machine Learning skills
- Generative AI skills
- APIs & Deployment skills

### 2. Project Proposal

Document your capstone project idea:

**Template:**
```
Title: [Project Name]

Problem: [What problem does this solve?]

Solution: [How will you solve it?]

Technologies: [What will you use?]

Timeline: [4-week breakdown]

Success Criteria: [How will you measure success?]
```

### 3. Portfolio Structure

Plan your repository structure:

```
my-portfolio/
├── README.md
├── projects/
│   ├── capstone/
│   ├── project-2/
│   └── project-3/
├── mini-projects/
│   ├── rag-system/
│   ├── ai-agent/
│   └── integration/
└── skills/
    ├── data-engineering.md
    ├── machine-learning.md
    └── generative-ai.md
```

### 4. Project Roadmap

Create a detailed timeline using `project_roadmap.py`:

```python
python project_roadmap.py
```

**4-Week Plan:**
- Week 1: Foundation and setup
- Week 2: Core implementation
- Week 3: Testing and polish
- Week 4: Deployment and documentation

### 5. Reflection

Complete `reflection.md` with thoughtful answers to:
- Technical skills questions
- Project planning questions
- Career goals questions
- Learning journey reflections
