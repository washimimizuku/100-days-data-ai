# Day 73: Prompt Engineering - Quiz

Test your understanding of prompt engineering principles and techniques.

## Questions

### 1. What is the main advantage of few-shot prompting over zero-shot prompting?
a) It's faster to execute
b) It provides examples that help the model understand the pattern
c) It uses less tokens
d) It works with smaller models

**Correct Answer: b**

### 2. Which of the following makes a prompt more effective?
a) Being as brief as possible
b) Using technical jargon
c) Being specific and providing clear instructions
d) Asking multiple questions at once

**Correct Answer: c**

### 3. What is the purpose of using delimiters (like triple backticks) in prompts?
a) To make the prompt look professional
b) To clearly separate instructions from content
c) To reduce token count
d) To enable special formatting

**Correct Answer: b**

### 4. In Chain of Thought prompting, what do you ask the model to do?
a) Generate multiple answers
b) Show its reasoning step-by-step
c) Summarize the input
d) Translate between languages

**Correct Answer: b**

### 5. What temperature setting is best for factual, deterministic tasks?
a) High (0.8-1.0)
b) Medium (0.5-0.7)
c) Low (0.0-0.3)
d) Temperature doesn't matter

**Correct Answer: c**

### 6. Which is an example of a well-structured prompt?
a) "Write something about AI"
b) "Explain AI in 100 words for beginners using simple analogies"
c) "AI?"
d) "Tell me everything about AI"

**Correct Answer: b**

### 7. What is prompt chaining?
a) Using multiple prompts in sequence, where each builds on the previous
b) Combining multiple prompts into one long prompt
c) Repeating the same prompt multiple times
d) Using prompts from different models

**Correct Answer: a**

### 8. When should you specify the output format in a prompt?
a) Never, let the model decide
b) Only for code generation
c) When you need structured or parseable output
d) Only for creative tasks

**Correct Answer: c**

### 9. What is a common pitfall in prompt engineering?
a) Being too specific
b) Providing too many examples
c) Giving ambiguous or unclear instructions
d) Using proper grammar

**Correct Answer: c**

### 10. How can you improve a prompt that's not giving good results?
a) Make it shorter
b) Add more technical terms
c) Iterate by adding specificity, examples, and constraints
d) Use all caps

**Correct Answer: c**

## Scoring Guide
- 9-10 correct: Excellent! You understand prompt engineering well.
- 7-8 correct: Good job! Review the topics you missed.
- 5-6 correct: Fair. Revisit the README and practice more.
- Below 5: Review the material and work through the exercises again.

## Answer Key
1. b - Few-shot prompting provides examples that demonstrate the desired pattern
2. c - Specific, clear instructions lead to better outputs
3. b - Delimiters clearly separate different parts of the prompt
4. b - Chain of Thought asks the model to show reasoning steps
5. c - Low temperature (0.0-0.3) produces more deterministic outputs
6. b - Specific length, audience, and technique make this effective
7. a - Prompt chaining uses sequential prompts that build on each other
8. c - Specify format when you need structured/parseable output
9. c - Ambiguous instructions lead to poor or inconsistent results
10. c - Iterative refinement with more detail improves prompts
